Real-time Threat Intelligence with Azure Sentinel

**Objective

To design and implement a robust Security Operations Center (SOC) using Azure Sentinel as the core SIEM platform. This project aims to: 

* **Deploy Azure Sentinel:** Configure and deploy Azure Sentinel to monitor and analyze security logs from various sources.
* **Integrate Threat Intelligence Feed:** Integrate a threat intelligence feed to enhance threat detection capabilities.
* **Create Custom Alerts:** Develop custom alerts for specific security events and anomalies.
* **Automate Incident Response:** Implement automated response actions for high-priority alerts.
* **Visualize Security Data:** Utilize Azure Sentinel's visualization tools to gain insights into security trends and patterns.


The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
